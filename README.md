**Research Fellow - Natural Hazards & Forest Biophysical Modeller** @ [Forest Hydrology Research Group](https://sefs-saf.unimelb.edu.au/research/themes/forests-and-water/) _(Feb 2023 - Present)_ <br>
Research and development of biophysical models for hydrology, geomorphology and wildfire risk in forested landscapes.
  - Oversaw use and development of a spatio-temporal fuel moisture content prediction machine learning model.
  - Managed the HydroFire phase 4 project from initiation to delivery, ensuring stakeholder engagement and funder satisfaction.
    - Developed a [post-fire flash flood model and runtime architecture](https://github.com/tom-keeble/HydroFire_FlashFlood) for use as rapid risk assessment software.
    - Built conceptual framework and model architecture for a post-fire water quality model and oversaw its backend development.
  - **_Technologies used:_** R, Python, ArcGIS, QGIS.

**Research Assistant** @ [Forest Hydrology Research Group](https://sefs-saf.unimelb.edu.au/research/themes/forests-and-water/) _(March 2022 - Feb 2023)_ <br>
Research support and project implementation in the area of post-fire hydrogeomorphic risk.
  - Implemented the HydroFire phase 3 project through milestone delivery to completion.
    - Developed a post-fire debris flow runout model for use across the state of Victoria, Australia and produced a statewide spatial dataset of runout risk areas to better facilitate risk assessments.
    - Rectified extensive errors in historic geoprocessing methods and output datasets.
  - **_Technologies used:_** R, Python, QGIS, ArcGIS.

**Forest Ecologist** @ [S & L Forestry](http://www.slforestry.com.au/) _(Aug 2021 - Oct 2021)_ <br>
Responsible for planning and delivery of flora surveys in remote, pre-harvest forest areas as part of large-scale contract works, whilst ensuring works occur safely and in compliance with the relevant legislation, including WHS&E.
- Conducted intensive surveys for critically threatened species, assessed and characterised forest areas and individual trees for habitat use and value, and evaluated growth stages to define old growth status.
- Collected and managed geospatial survey data and implemented quality control checks to ensure its accuracy and completeness.
- Liaised and coordinated with contract manager to establish efficient operational priorities and delivery of collected data.
- **_Technologies used:_** GPS navigation, spatial collection applications.

**Bushland Maintenance Officer** @ [City of Whittlesea](https://www.whittlesea.vic.gov.au/) _(Jan 2021 - May 2021)_ <br>
- Responsible for the management of conservation reserves throughout the municipality for conservation and biodiversity values.
- Conducting vegetation mapping and assessment, chemical and manual weed control, planting and revegetation, habitat construction, bushfire preparedness and the delivery of an ecological burn program in compliance with relevant legislation, WHS&E, and safe operating procedures.
- Developing a vegetation type monitoring system to assess contractor weed management performance post ecological burn operations, thereby ensuring efficient and cost-effective contract delivery.
