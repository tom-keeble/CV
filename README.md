## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Experience

**Research Fellow - Natural Hazards & Forest Biophysical Modeller** @ [Forest Hydrology Research Group](https://sefs-saf.unimelb.edu.au/research/themes/forests-and-water/) _(Feb 2023 - Present)_ <br>
Research and development of biophysical models for hydrology, geomorphology and wildfire risk in forested landscapes.
  - Oversaw use and development of a spatio-temporal fuel moisture content prediction machine learning model ([Publication](#fmc_modsim)). <br>  
  - Managed the HydroFire phase 4 project from initiation to delivery, ensuring stakeholder engagement and funder satisfaction.
    - Developed  a [post-fire flash flood model](https://github.com/tom-keeble/HydroFire_FlashFlood) and a [post-fire water quality risk model](https://github.com/tom-keeble/HydroFire_WaterQuality) bundled as software for use by land managers and related agencies for planning purposes and rapid risk assessment.
    - Built conceptual framework and model architecture for said models and provided consultation regarding their backend development and implementation within government systems.
    - Developed supporting R package ([ARRtools](https://github.com/tom-keeble/ARRtools)) containing tools for implementing Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) hydrology assessment methods. <br>  
  - Implemented and validated state-of-the-art changes to the [Integrated Forest Ecosystem Research Decision Support System (DSS)](https://www.ffm.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/410941/IFER-DSS-Fact-Sheet-Final.pdf) water yield model predictions, incorporating recent novel findings of [Inbar et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158410) and [Benyon et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129157). <br>  
  - **_Technologies used:_** R, Python, ArcGIS, QGIS.
<br><br>

**Research Assistant** @ [Forest Hydrology Research Group](https://sefs-saf.unimelb.edu.au/research/themes/forests-and-water/) _(March 2022 - Feb 2023)_ <br>
Research support and project implementation in the area of post-fire hydrogeomorphic risk.
  - Implemented the HydroFire phase 3 project through milestone delivery to completion.
    - Developed a post-fire debris flow runout model for use across the state of Victoria, Australia and produced a statewide spatial dataset of runout risk areas to better facilitate risk assessments ([Publication](#df_preprint)).
    - Rectified extensive errors in historic geoprocessing methods and output datasets.
<br>
  - **_Technologies used:_** R, Python, QGIS, ArcGIS.
<br><br>

**Forest Ecologist** @ [S & L Forestry](http://www.slforestry.com.au/) _(Aug 2021 - Oct 2021)_ <br>
Responsible for planning and delivery of flora surveys in remote, pre-harvest forest areas as part of large-scale contract works, whilst ensuring works occur safely and in compliance with the relevant legislation, including WHS&E.
- Conducted intensive surveys for critically threatened species, assessed and characterised forest areas and individual trees for habitat use and value, and evaluated growth stages to define old growth status.
- Collected and managed geospatial survey data and implemented quality control checks to ensure its accuracy and completeness.
- Liaised and coordinated with contract manager to establish efficient operational priorities and delivery of collected data.
- **_Technologies used:_** GPS navigation, spatial survey data collection (via Esri [Survey123](https://survey123.arcgis.com/) and [FieldMaps](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/fieldmaps/) apps).
<br><br>

**Bushland Maintenance Officer** @ [City of Whittlesea](https://www.whittlesea.vic.gov.au/) _(Jan 2021 - May 2021)_ <br>
Responsible for the management of conservation reserves throughout the municipality for conservation and biodiversity values.
- Conducted vegetation mapping and assessment, chemical and manual weed control, planting and revegetation, habitat construction, bushfire preparedness and the delivery of an ecological burn program in compliance with relevant legislation, WHS&E, and safe operating procedures.
- Developed a vegetation type monitoring system to assess contractor weed management performance post ecological burn operations, thereby ensuring efficient and cost-effective contract delivery.
<br><br>

_Previously worked as an Outdoor Educator from Feb 2014 - Mar 2020_ <br>
  - Guiding a broad range of single-day tours, through to 14-day expeditions throughout Australian National Parks and wilderness areas for various schools, including: hiking; bushwalking; canoeing; skiing; and conservation-focused trips.
- Managed logistics, safety and participant wellbeing in compliance with Adventure Activity Standard (AAS) Guidelines.
- Facilitated participant learning and development using a range of teaching tools in conjunction with the outdoor experience.
